First let me say thanks for downloading and trying out wrench! I work on 
this for my personal products/hobbies on time available.

Having said that I take great pride in this code being clean and
warning/bug-free, I tackle bug reports as soon as I get them.


Top Priority: things I'm actively (when I have time) am working on:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
completion  description
-------------------------------------------------------------------
5%			Spiffs lib implementation
5%			LittleFS lib implementation
40%			Debug builds that allow stepping/inspecting/remote debugging



Second Priority: stuff that would be nice
-------------------------------------------------------------------
complete Arduino lib
complete esp32 lib
figure out std::hash().. there is a problem becuase of the scrambler*, the hash it returns is NOT the hash used internally
  *the what? in order fo hash '0' to be both the number (integers are their own hashes) AND "no hash" I intgroduce a scrambler
   constant that is XORed with all hashes. That way "0" is the scrambler itself, and actual 0 is the null hash. The only
   danger with this is if your string happens to collide with the scrambler value, a 1:4bil chance but that same possibility
   exists with using null as the null hash, thats what bitcoin is :)
   I guess it would be annoying if you wanted to use the numeric value of the scrambler as an integer hash key, so I chose
   a very large+negative value: 0xA656ABAB to minimize that risk
